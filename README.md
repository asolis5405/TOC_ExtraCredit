**1. What was the work?**
- Created a PDA that accepts the language L = {a^(2n)d^(n)|0}
- Translated the PDA into a Deterministic Turing Machine that accepts the same language
- Turned the DTM into a .csv file

**2. Why did you choose this work?**
  I felt that I lacked an understanding of TMs. Because I felt I had mastered the topic of PDAs on Homework 7A (problems 2,4,and 5), I figured it would help me to understand TMs more to try and convert a PDA to a DTM. I started by creating an original PDA that would accept the language  L = {a^(2n)d^(n)|0}, which was not too difficult. The challenging part came when having to translate from the PDA to DTM, since PDAs work with stacks to keep track of the characters that have been read and DTM don't. I used the same technique I had used on homework 8 to accomplsh the same functionality.
  
**3. What files are what?**

  DTM csv file: a2ndnDTM.csv
  - This file contains the csv version of the DTM I created. It follows the format of test files from Project 2

State Diagrams: EC_PDAtoDTM.pdf
- This file contains the state diagrams of the translation from PDA to DTM
